In the e-commerce database schema, the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities have a one-to-many relationship. A product can belong to one category, while a category can encompass multiple products. This connection is maintained through the "category_id" foreign key in the "Product" table, which references the primary key "id" in the "Product_Category" table. In essence, the "category_id" ensures that each product's category corresponds to a valid category ID in the "Product_Category" table
To ensure each product has a valid category:Database Level: Use foreign key constraints on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table, linking it to the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table.Application Level: Implement logic in the application to check and confirm a valid category ID is selected before saving product data.
